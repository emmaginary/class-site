<a href="../pages/haircolortypes.html"> Types of Hair Dye </a>
</p>

<h3>Gray Coverage</h3>
<p> Gray hair acts almost like coarse hair, and therefore needs stronger processes to be covered. Permanent colors are an option, as well as a few special formulated rinses and semi permanent colors.</p>

<h3>Lift & Deposit Dyes</h3>
<p> There are a few dyes on the market known as "lift and deposit" colors, which does exactly as the name suggests. Using 30 volume developer makes this process possible. Formulated for darker hair, these products will lift the cuticle of the hair and proceed to lift the color of the cortex approxiamtely 3 levels, then deposit the desired color. Think of it as combining the steps of bleaching and then dying your hair in one. Theoretically, you could mix 30 vol with a Permanent color for a similar result, but I personally have had the best luck with brands that are specifically lift & deposit.</p>

<h2>Mixing Ratios</h2>
<p>The mixing ratio refers to the amount of developer mixed with the hair color. It will typically appear written as "1:1" which translates to 1 oz of product to 1 oz. (Say your hair color was 4 oz, you would need 4 oz of developer.) The typical ratio for permanent color will be one part color, one part developer. Adding double the amount of developer will cause the color itself to lighten. It will vary by brand, and to figure out the recommended ratio look on the box for the brand's instructions.</p>

<h2>Decoding Names</h2>
<p> At the store colors will be numbered 1 - 10, referring to the <a href="../pages/levels.html">levels</a> mentioned earlier. After you decide what shade you'd like, you'll notice there colors usually have a letter following the number. This is referring to the undertones of the haircolor, and can help you be more specific with shades. For warmer shades, look for "G" for Golden or "R" for Red. For cooler shades, look at "N" for Nuetral, "V" for Violet, "B" for Blue or "A" for Ash.</p>

<h2> Application </h2>
<p> When applying an all over color, there is no right or wrong way to color your hair. To ensure an even saturation, I recommend following the <a href="../pages/sectioning.html">sectioning</a> mentioned earlier, applying color to all the roots first following that method and then apply the rest of the color to your sections. You'll want a non-metallic bowl, an applicator brush, clips and gloves. Happy Painting!
