<h2>Sectioning</h2>
<p>
When looking at the anatomy of the skull, you'll want to locate the crown of the head we're working on. from that point, you can draw a straight line down from the crown to the nape of the neck, and have your back sections. you'll then want to draw a line horizontally with your comb, and drop down the bottom layer of the hair. When cutting hair this is a solid way to establish your baseline. For hair coloring, it is usually recommended to start at the back, as there is less heat in that area and the processes usually take longest in that area. You should use this horizontal line as a base for removing hair from your sections when completing a process.
