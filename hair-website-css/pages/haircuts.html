    <h1> The Blunt Cut </h1>
    <p>
      This will be an all over one length hair cut. Referencing the sectioning mentioned in <a href="../pages/thebasics.html"> The Basics </a>, we can begin our blunt cut.
      Using the first one inch section that you've removed, cut off the desired length in a straight line. The usual for a trim is 1 inch off, but you can cut as much as you like. Remember, you can always cut off more later. The key to correct lines
      in your haircut is making sure your fingers that you use to hold the hair while cutting are held in the same angle as your parting. For the blunt cut, make sure to hold your fingers horizontal to your part. Using a comb to detangle the hair,
      you can work your way through the section, following your initial cut.

      Once you complete your section, remove another one inch section from above your previous parting. Following your guideline, cut the section. Repeat until you've reached the top of the head. As you reach the front sections of the head, brush the
      hair over the ear to meet your back guideline. You can also include a bottom section of your front partings in your intitial section to ensure an even cut all around.

      Congratulations, you've completed a blunt haircut!
