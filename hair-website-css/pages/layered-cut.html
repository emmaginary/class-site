    <h1> The Layered Cut </h1>
    <p>
      Follow the steps for setting your basic back guideline from the blunt cut.
      <br>
      <br>
      Face the front of your client. Take a one inch section from the front section and drop it down vertically along the face. Cut off the desired length for your shortest layer. This will become your guideline for the rest of your layers.
      <br>
      <br>
      Divide the hair on top into a horizontal one inch section on either side of the head to begin cutting the layers.
      Lift your freshly cut guideline at a 90 degree angle above the head. Comb your one inch section upwards, holding both your guide and your section with your fingers. Trim your one inch section to your guideline. Work your way through the section
      until complete.
      <br>
      <br>
      Take another horizontal one inch section out from underneath the one you just cut. Comb all these peices upwards at a 90 degree angle. Working your way through the section, trim to the previously cut section. When you have completed this new
      section & drop it down, you will begin to see the layers form.
      <br>
      <br>
      Repeat this process for the entire head. Take a horizontal one inch section from below the one you just cut, brush it upwards 90 degrees to meet your guideline, trim & drop. Do this to each side of the head on either side until complete.
      <br>
      <br>
      Congratulations, you've completed a layered haircut!
